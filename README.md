## Introduction

Brain hemorrhage is a critical condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. This project aims to leverage deep learning to classify brain images into normal and hemorrhagic categories. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.


## Setup

To set up the environment, install the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The main dependencies are:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn


## Data Preprocessing

The dataset consists of brain images that need to be preprocessed before training the model. The preprocessing steps include:

    1. Loading images from the dataset.
    2. Resizing and normalizing the images.
    3. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
    4. Augmenting the training data to improve model generalization.

Example code for loading and preprocessing the data:

```python
import os
from PIL import Image
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Load and preprocess the data
# Your data loading and preprocessing code here
```
## Model Training

The neural network model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture includes convolutional layers for feature extraction and dense layers for classification. Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting.

Example code for building and training the model:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout

# Define the model architecture
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(image_height, image_width, channels)),
    MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    # Add more layers as needed
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history = model.fit(train_data, epochs=epochs, validation_data=val_data)
```
## Results

After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test dataset. The results include accuracy, loss, and other relevant metrics. Visualizations of the training process and sample predictions are provided.
